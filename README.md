# ML Deep Learning project: Traffic Sign Recognition using 6 different models (AlexNet/DenseNet/ResNet50/ResNet101/VGGNet/CNN Model)

In this project, I developed a Traffic Sign Classification model using various neural network architectures, including AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGGNet, and CNN. The objective was to accurately classify traffic signs based on their visual features.

I trained and evaluated each model using a large dataset of traffic sign images. The training process involved optimizing the model parameters and adjusting hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. I utilized different architectural configurations for each model to explore their capabilities in traffic sign classification.

Eexperimental results showed remarkable accuracy across the different models. The model accuracies ranged from 96% to 98% during training, indicating their ability to learn and classify the various traffic sign classes accurately. Furthermore, the test accuracy results ranged between 86% to 97%, demonstrating the models' generalization performance on unseen data.

The comparison of the different neural network models highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture. Some models, such as ResNet50 and ResNet101, showcased excellent performance due to their deep and residual network structures. Others, such as VGGNet and AlexNet, also achieved high accuracies by leveraging different convolutional layers and pooling operations.

Overall, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing various neural network architectures for traffic sign classification. The obtained accuracies provide evidence of the models' capability to recognize and classify traffic signs accurately. These findings contribute to the development of intelligent transportation systems and pave the way for enhanced road safety through automated traffic sign recognition.

This projects offers valuable experience in managing real-world image datasets, crafting and training CNNs, evaluating model efficacy, and deploying sophisticated deep learning solutions with tangible real-world benefits. The project not only fosters technical skill growth but also contributes to elevating road safety standards through state-of-the-art technology.
